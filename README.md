# npm Package

#### Just made a simple npm package to check my knowledge on creating and publishing npm packages. <br>
#### It's a simple date package where one can install the package in the required project directory to get the present date by running this command on the terminal:  
### 'npm i date-mks'

<br>

### My npmjs profile: https://www.npmjs.com/~mayankks13
